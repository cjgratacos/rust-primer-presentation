# Macros

- Rust has two types of macros, this are: declaritive macros and procedural marcros.
- Declarative macros are defined within the `macro_rules!` macro. Example of this are `println!`, `vec!`, etc.
- Procedural macros can be defined as 3 types, and this are:
    - Custom `#[derive]` macros
    - Attribute like macros
    - Function like macros
- Macros are Rust way of metaprogramming (aka code writing code).
