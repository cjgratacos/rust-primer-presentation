# Rust Primer

## What is Rust?

According to Wikipedia, Rust is a:

- multi-paradigm
- high-level
- general-purpose programming language
- emphasize on: 
	- performance
	- type safety 
	- concurrency 
- enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages
- to simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, Rust's "borrow checker" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation
